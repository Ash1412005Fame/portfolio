# My Portfolio Website

This is my portfolio website, built as a project to learn the basics of web development, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's a starting point for showcasing my skills and projects, and I will continue to improve and update it as I learn more.

## What I Learned
- **HTML**: Building the structure of the website, creating elements like headings, paragraphs, images, and links.
- **CSS**: Styling the website to make it look nice and visually appealing. I used things like color schemes, fonts, and layout techniques.
- **JavaScript**: Adding interactivity to the website. This could be things like buttons, forms, or any dynamic content that changes based on user interaction.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: To create the basic structure of the website.
- **CSS**: To style the layout and design the look and feel of the website.
- **JavaScript**: To add interactivity and enhance the user experience.
